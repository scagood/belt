# belt.js

This is a holder of a utlility belt currently in constrction.
I'm very sure that some of these dont work :)
If you find a function that doesn't work, could you create an issue [github.com/scagood/belt/issues](https://github.com/scagood/belt/issues/new) I'd be most grateful :P

## TODO - currently being worked on that is
* Documentation.
* AVA Tests

## Things in the future
* Basic matrix generation (2D and 3D rotatio)
* Collision calculations
  * n-point Polygons
  * Circles
* Gift wrapping points
* Improved statistics functions (n-dimentional 'mean' calculation for example)
* A super simple events system
* Points array given (x,y) and a radius
* Points array given polygon points ([[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...,[xn,yn]])
* Array smoothing (gaussian & box filter)
* Midpoint Convolution (1D & 2D) (N-dimensional at somepoint)
* 2D Array '.slice', '.pop' & '.shift' (Non-mutating) (N-dimensional at somepoint... maybe?)
* Element dissociation (I've been having mutation problems recently :)
* Yet another Diamond Square implimentation :+1:
* Colour Interpolation (Color Interpolation [for all yee 'color' people])
